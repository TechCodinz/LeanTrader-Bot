## 🎮 Quick Start

### 1. Basic Installation
```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements_ultra.txt

# Or minimal installation
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn ccxt
```

### 2. Launch the System

#### Easy Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Paper trading (simulated)
./start_ultra.sh paper

# Backtest mode
./start_ultra.sh backtest

# Live trading (requires confirmation)
./start_ultra.sh live
```

#### Advanced Mode
```bash
# With custom configuration
python ultra_launcher.py --mode paper --config my_config.json

# Train models first
python ultra_launcher.py --train --symbols BTC/USDT ETH/USDT SOL/USDT

# Custom risk settings
python ultra_launcher.py --mode paper --risk 0.01 --evolution
```

## 🧬 How It Evolves

The Ultra Trading System implements a multi-layered evolution strategy:

### Generation 0: Initial Training
- Trains ensemble models on historical data
- Establishes baseline performance metrics
- Initializes Q-learning tables

### Generation 1+: Continuous Evolution
1. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors win rate, Sharpe ratio, drawdown
2. **Fitness Calculation**: Evaluates strategy effectiveness
3. **Parameter Mutation**: Adjusts risk, confidence thresholds, position sizes
4. **Strategy Selection**: Keeps successful mutations, discards failures
5. **Online Learning**: Updates models with recent performance

### Evolution Metrics
- **Fitness Score**: Overall strategy performance (0-1)
- **Generation**: Current evolution iteration
- **Mutations**: Applied strategy modifications
- **Adaptations**: Successful improvements kept

## 🎯 Configuration

Create a `config.json` file:

```json
{
    "mode": "paper",
    "symbols": ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT", "SOL/USDT"],
    "timeframes": ["1m", "5m", "15m", "1h"],
    "exchange": "binance",
    "max_positions": 5,
    "risk_per_trade": 0.02,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.65,
    "evolution_enabled": true,
    "online_learning": true,
    "multi_exchange": false,
    "use_news_sentiment": true,
    "use_onchain_data": true,
    "initial_capital": 10000,
    "stop_loss_pct": 0.05,
    "take_profit_pct": 0.10,
    "max_drawdown_pct": 0.20
}
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

The system provides real-time performance metrics:

- **Total Trades**: Number of executed trades
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Total PnL**: Cumulative profit/loss
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
