   - Risk: Conservative, high-frequency trades

2. **Phase 2 (Month 2-3)**: $100 → $300
   - Focus: Trend following and momentum
   - Agents: Mixed strategy approach
   - Risk: Moderate, balanced approach

3. **Phase 3 (Month 4-5)**: $300 → $800
   - Focus: Black swan opportunity capture
   - Agents: All specializations active
   - Risk: Aggressive, opportunity-focused

4. **Phase 4 (Month 6)**: $800 → $3000-5000
   - Focus: Maximum profit extraction
   - Agents: Full swarm intelligence
   - Risk: Optimized for target achievement

### **Adaptive Risk Management**
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Adjusts based on account size
